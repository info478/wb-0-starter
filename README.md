While this assignment is not for credit, it allows you to refresh your skills with R, GitHub, and the submission process on Canvas. 

## Instructions
After cloning this repository, you should do the following:
1. Create an `R Markdown` file with the name `index.Rmd`
2. Create a second file called `analysis.R`
3. Download some data into a folder `data/`
4. In your `analysis.R` file, load the data, and create a visualization of your choice using `ggplot2`. Save this plot to a variable so you can load it in to your `index.Rmd` file.
5. In your `index.Rmd` file, `source()` your `analysis.R` script and display your visualization. 
6. Click the **Knit** button to compile your `index.Rmd` file into an `index.html` file.
7. You should now `add`, `commit` (don't forget to include a message with `-m "Some message"`), and `push` your code.
8. You should now be able to view your project at https://info478-s20.github.io/wb-0-USERNAME (where `USERNAME` is _your_ GitHub username)
9. Submit the URL where you can view your project to Canvas, and please make a comment that includes the URL where your code is hosted

We will follow these steps for nearly every workbook and assignment, so please make sure you feel comfortable with them.
